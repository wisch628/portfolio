After graduating from Northwestern University, I was hired at Open Door Legal, a rapidly growing Bay Area non-profit and 2015 Google Impact Challenge winner. While there, I raised over $1.5 million through web development, design, and marketing. 

Last summer, I was tasked with rebuilding our website, an entirely new endeavor for me. I loved the process, and when I finished, I began to spend my nights and weekends on Free Code Camp tirelessly working through their Javascript and Responsive Web Development certificates. The more I learned about web development, the more I realized this was the career path for me. 

In January, I quit my job and enrolled full time into the Grace Hopper program, which is a competitive full-stack software engineering training program for women and non-binary developers. The curriculum covered Javascript, React, Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, Git, testing, design, and more.
