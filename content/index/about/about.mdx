After graduating from Northwestern University, I was hired at Open Door Legal, a rapidly growing Bay Area non-profit. While there, I raised over \$1.5 million through web development, design, and marketing.

Last summer, I was tasked with rebuilding our website, an entirely new endeavor for me. I loved the process, and when I finished, I began to spend my nights and weekends working through the Free Code Camp Javascript and Responsive Web Development certificates. The more I learned about web development, the more I realized this was the career path for me.

In February, I quit my job and enrolled in Grace Hopper, which is a competitive full-stack software engineering training program for women and non-binary developers.

Since then, I have built three full-stack applications as well as multiple side projects, including this portfolio!
