Meedle is a live location sharing application that helps friends find an optimal place to meet in the middle. It keeps track of users’ real time geolocations, and uses the Google Maps API to generate a meeting place that will equalize travel time for all users.

Meedle was built with React, Redux, Node.Js, Express, Socket.io, Turf.js, Nodemailer, PostgreSQL, and Sequelize. Building this application, we learned how to track users’ geolocation, implement API security, and manage multi-user live data sharing.
