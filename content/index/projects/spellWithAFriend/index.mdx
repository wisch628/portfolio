Spell with a Friend is an application that scrapes live data from NYTimes Games to allow users to play a multiplayer version of the Spelling Bee. Users can submit words, see other playersâ€™ words, chat with friends, and save game data to come back and play later. Games are inactivated at 3 am when the NYTimes Spelling Bee letters reset.

Spell with a Friend is deployed on an AWS EC2 and was built with Puppeteer, Socket.io, React, Redux, Node.Js, Express, PostgreSQL, and Sequelize.
